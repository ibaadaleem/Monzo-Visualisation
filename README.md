# Monzo-Visualisation
Monzo Visualisation Webapp

Built in Python 3.6

### Purpose
Monzo is a new startup bank that provides your banking data in real time, so you don't have to wait up to 3 days to see your transactions. The ease of access to this data is great, but I wanted to take it a step further and see a breakdown of what I've been spending, so I created this webapp in Python so I can break down my spending by week/month/category as well as graph it.
